<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The COVID Tracking Project was a collaborative volunteer-run effort to track the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic all over the world. It maintained a daily-updated dataset of state-level information related to the outbreak, including counts of the number of cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths, the racial and ethnic demographic breakdowns of cases and deaths, and cases and deaths in long-term care facilities.</p>
